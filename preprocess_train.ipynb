I feel like I have already spent too much time on this and that your team should have enough information to test for yourselves by putting two images into the tool and sending emails to yourselves to see if this happens. I simply don't have time for it and am going to use only one image when I send out email even if it is well below ideal.\",\n",

The engineer believes that it would be better if you create new signature using the formatting options available in Pipedrive, because copied-pasted signatures can cause issues. He checked the database and saw same the text as in the duplicate signature. And asked you to please share with us a screenshot of the signature field in your mail composer. I made this GIF to show you where to do it: advance!',\n",
