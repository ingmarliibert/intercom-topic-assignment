       "[\"reaching out to support! Apologies for the wait. The permission sets/user roles depend on the plan which you are on. For example on the Essential plan you have the admin and regular users, and on Advanced plan there is also the manager role. However both of your companies are on the Professional plan which allows for any custom roles and also gives you the option to delete roles. In this case it seems a role was possibly deleted, however you can also add roles with their own permission sets by clicking on the Add set button at the bottom of the available options: There you'll be able to recreate the Manager set. For reference, the only permissions not available to a Manager (aside from Admin-only privileges like adding users and modifying billing etc) are importing items and modifying labels: Hopes this helps to create the manager role in your {{name}} company but of course these permissions can also be set to your preferences. If there's anything else I can help you with feel free to reach out. Have an awesome day! ðŸ˜ƒ\",\n",

I will ask our engineers to investigate perhaps there is some feature that is incorrectly disabled or a bug affecting this account, but you should be able to create other sets.

Regarding the notes not being viewable on a deal can you share some screenshot examples of a note you can see and ask the user who can't see the note to share a screenshot of the same? Please make sure the whole screen is visible including the URL so that we can identify the deals and make sure t and use the deal ID to investigate on the back end in case it's a bug.
